# TODO App

A simple TODO list Android application built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Room Database. This app follows Clean Architecture principles for better maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Task list sorted by status and creation date
- Persistent storage with Room Database
- Modern UI using Jetpack Compose
- Responsive for different screen sizes

## Modules

- **Presentation**: UI layer built with Jetpack Compose
- **Domain**: Business logic and use cases
- **Data**: Handles local data storage using Room Database
- **DI**: Dependency injection setup for modular code

## Clean Architecture

The project is organized into layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI and user interaction logic
- **Domain Layer**: Application-specific business rules
- **Data Layer**: Data sources and repositories

This separation makes the codebase easier to test, maintain, and extend.

## Android Features Used

- Room Database for local storage
- Jetpack Compose for UI
